### "Comprehensive Rust" (`comprehensive-rust`)

This directory contains examples and tutorial code  based-on me going through Google's "Comprehensive Rust" online book.

See the local [README](./comprehensive-rust/) for more details.

### "Fullstack Rust" (`fullstack-rust`)

This directory contains examples and tutorial code based-on me going through the "Fullstack Rust" (2020, first edition) book, which can be purchased [here](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-rust).

### Machine Learning in Rust with `libtorch` (`ml-libtorch`)

This directory uses the `tch-rs` package to bind to `libtorch` and shows some examples of how to do Machine Learning in Rust, similar to using PyTorch in Python.

## What's this "tommy teaches tommy" thing all about?

_"What's in a name?"_

You can see a rambly explanation [here at my personal website](https://tommypkeane.com/about-tommy/tommy-teaches-tommy.html); but, in short:

I'm just trying to say that I'm writing out what I think is helpful/interesting to me, and I'm sharing it in case it's helpful to anyone else, but please know that I'm ___not___ trying to talk _down_ to anyone :smile: (except maybe myself :ghost:).
